			<p>Hello <span id="greeting"></span>,</p>
			<p>There are just a few spots left in the UW <a href="http://expd.uw.edu/pipeline/alternative-spring-break/literacy-arts-asb/">Literacy Arts Alternative Spring Break</a> program! We have extended the deadline to <b>January 11th.</b> Could you please share this reminder with the <span id="insertdept"></span> students and encourage them to apply? The application can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYFbWqB0-Z9kgRf1tRdZ5hWiwb_y-LhqOhj9vptRVWQe4EtQ/viewform">here</a>.</p>
			<p>Students in your department have interests and skills that are highly desired by the rural and tribal communities that we work with over Spring Break. This is an excellent opportunity for students to gain experience in curriculum-building, teaching,
				and engaging in cultural exchange and exploration. Thank you for sharing this opportunity with them!</p>
			<p>If you have any questions about this program, please let me know.</p>
			<p>Thanks,
				<br><span id="closing"></span>
